    <p1>Hello, my name is <ins>Jonathan Grabowski</ins> and I currently am a first year student
    at <em>North Carolina State University</em>. <strong>I am studying engineering with an intent
    of civil engineering</strong>. I chose to be an engineer because while I was growing up I
    took a woodworking class. In this class I learned how to design and build things
    using the engineering process. It allowed me to fall in love with the work and
    pursue being an engineer.  </p1>
    <br />
    <p> During the summer when I was working I worked for the <ins>Chapel Hill Country
    Club</ins>. I was a <em>food runner</em> and worked to serve tables as a food runner. I enjoyed 
    this job because when I was working I was always busy and there was no waiting 
    around. <strong>When I do a job I do not enjoy when there is a lot of downtime</strong>. </p>
